This is a re-implementation of https://github.com/dean/flatterer in NodeJS!

To begin, run the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Install required packages
    npm install
    
    # Copy over your 
    cp config.json.dist config.json

    # Compile es6->es5
    gulp build

    # Start the server!
    npm start
    ```

We use ES6 syntax for compilation, so you will need to build before running the server.
To build, run:
    `gulp build`
